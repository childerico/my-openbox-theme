# my-openbox-theme

This is a theme for OpenBox 3.x. I customized it for a good integration with
Gtk theme [Arc Theme](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme).

I forked this theme from *Bear-tangerine* by *envyouraudience19*, found
[here](http://box-look.org/content/show.php/bear-tangerine?content=59636),
which is distributed under terms of GPL license.

## Installation ##

On most distributions, you just need to copy `my-openbox-theme` directory (contained
		in this repository) to `/usr/share/themes/`.

Then you should set this theme as your OpenBox theme (e.g. using `obconf`).
