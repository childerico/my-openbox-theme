# my-openbox-theme

This is a theme for OpenBox 3.x. I customized it for a good integration with
Gtk theme [Arc Theme](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme).

I forked this theme from *Bear-tangerine* by *envyouraudience19*, found
[here](http://box-look.org/content/show.php/bear-tangerine?content=59636),
which is distributed under terms of GPL license.

## Installation ##

On most distributions, you just need to copy theme's directory
to `/usr/share/themes/`, after cloning this repository:

	git clone https://github.com/childerico/my-openbox-theme.git
	sudo cp -r my-openbox-theme/my-openbox-theme /usr/share/themes/

Then you should set this theme as your OpenBox theme (e.g. using `obconf`).

**Optionally**, you could save the theme with a more meaningful name:
	
	sudo cp -r my-openbox-theme/my-openbox-theme /usr/share/themes/NEW_NAME
